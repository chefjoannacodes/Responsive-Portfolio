## Description 
Using last week's Basic-Portfolio, and media queries, I created a 3-page responsive portfolio with my picture, bio, projects, and contact page. 

## Requirements
#### 
-Without using Bootstrap, make the portfolio responsive at 3 sizes.
-use three '@ media screen' tags with 'max-width's:'980px, 768px, and 640px'.
-Use the provided screenshots to get my portfolio to match the instructor's portfolio.


## Technologies Used
#### 
-HTML
-CSS
-media queries

## Code Explaination
- I placed the media queries at the bottom of the CSS. Using the Chrome Inspector, and the screenshots provided by the instructor, I adjusted the CSS until it matched the instructor's screenshots at each specific width. 
-i.e. the media query for the mobile version(640px) began like this 
```
 @media only screen and (max-width:640px){
  #masthead {
    position: static;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }


```
